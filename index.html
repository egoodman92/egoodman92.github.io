    <p align="justify">
    As a fifth year PhD student at Stanford University, I combine simulation, modeling, and atomic imaging techniques to gain insight into the structure of materials and the nature of <a href="https://suncat.stanford.edu/about" target="_blank">chemical reactions</a>. I received my BS in both <a href="https://cce.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">chemical engineering</a> and <a href="https://www.hss.caltech.edu/academics/undergraduate-studies/social-sciences-options/business-economics-and-management" target="_blank">business, economics, and management</a> from Caltech in 2015. My primary research interests lie in applying machine learning models to understand complex reaction dynamics and in combining computer vision and transmission electron microscopy.

    Throughout my PhD, I have spent over 1000 hours studying the nanostructure of materials via image analysis and transmission electron microscopy. Past collaborators have included the <a href="https://foundry.lbl.gov/about/facilities/the-national-center-for-electron-microscopy-ncem/" target="_blank"> National Center for Electron Microscopy</a> and <a href="https://www.fei.com/" target="_blank"> ThermoFischer Scientific</a>. Through combining computer vision and transmission electron microscopy, I hope to teach computers how to <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1opR0jc2pDa0JGX9nnGI-Z8XlVh-8qNpt/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">identify the atomic structure of materials and molecules</a>.

    <p align="justify">
    I have published works in the areas of image processing and microscopy, modeling chemical phenomena, and nanomaterials. These works have resulted in 11 conference presentations and 19 peer-reviewed papers in journals such as Nature Catalysis, PNAS, JACS, and Nano Today. Highlights include first author publications in Nature Catalysis (featured article and cover art) and the Journal of Chemical Physics (Editor's choice).

    In the summers of 2017, 2018, and 2019 I was involved with the Global Climate and Energy Project hosted by the Precourt Institute for Energy. In 2017, I was a selected as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKyJ24ZaPDk" target="_blank"> GCEP distinguished student lecturer</a>, and in 2018 and 2019 I was <a href="https://energy.stanford.edu/student-lectures-2019" target="_blank"> seminar organizer and manager </a> for the 10-week lecture series. 
     
    <br><br>
    For the past three years, I have been an <a href="https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/enhancing-diversity-graduate/details" target="_blank">Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education (EDGE)</a> mentor, working with new students from under-represented backgrounds transition into Stanford PhD programs.

    <br><br>
    As a first student of a new Stanford faculty member, building a research environment has been a fun part of my PhD. This experience involved a grant to<a href="news:stanford:edu/2017/07/26/stanford-faculty-students-staff-win-grants-advance-diversity/" target="_blank"> advance diversity </a> through mentoring students and visiting their high schools to encourage STEM careers.
