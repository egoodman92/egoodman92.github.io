        <p>Every so often for a project, you need to do some web-scraping. For those of us that see this as a once-in-a-while task, we may be reminded of the pain of scraping, as an annoying convolution of BeautifulSoup, maybe Selenium, and maybe Chromedriver. If memory serves, you need to understand the specific structure of various websites in order to get the exact information you care about, and once the website changes, all that is gone, and you may need to start over. And for any real website, there are often security barriers, request limitations, etc, making you want to avoid the day you next need to do a web-scraping project.</p>

        <p>For someone with a hammer, many things may look like a nail. As someone more well-versed in deep learning over the last five years rather than traditional software engineering (ChemEng by training), there seemed to be a silly possibility of using new SOTA Vision Language Models (VLMs) like GPT-4o to help us here.</p>
        

        <h2>Stage 1: Scrape Web Images with Chromedriver</h2>
        <p>The first stage uses Chromedriver to pull up a browser, and scroll through a website in minimally-overlapping shots, to capture the entire page. These screenshots are saved in a directory. Using chromedriver in this way ensures that even dynamic content loaded via JavaScript is captured, providing a complete visual record of the webpage.</p>

        <h2>Stage 2: OCR with GPT-4o VLM</h2>
        <p>In the second stage, the saved screenshots are processed to extract text using GPT-4o's Vision Language Model (VLM). This script encodes each image into base64 format and sends them in batches to the GPT-4o API. The API performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on the images, transcribing the text content, which is then saved as separate text files. This step transforms visual data into machine-readable text, making it ready for further processing.</p>

        <h2>Stage 3: Synthesize Full Transcript</h2>
        <p>The final stage involves combining the transcriptions into a coherent article. This script reads the individual text files generated by the OCR process, concatenates them, and sends the combined text to the GPT-4o API. The API synthesizes the text into a structured and coherent article, which is then saved as a final text file. This step transforms raw transcriptions into a polished document suitable for analysis or publication.</p>
